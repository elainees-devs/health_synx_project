# üîê Security Overview for Health Synx

The **Health Synx Hospital Management System** is designed with multiple layers of security to protect sensitive patient and hospital data. Below is a detailed summary of how the system enforces security across authentication, data protection, and deployment.

---

## üß± 1. Authentication & Authorization

**Custom User Model**

* Extends Django's `AbstractUser` with fields for `role`, `department`, and `patient_type`.
* Supports multiple user types (Admin, Doctor, Nurse, etc.) with granular access control.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

* Views are restricted by role using:
  * **Django decorators** (`@role_required([...])`) for traditional views
  * **DRF Permission Classes** (`RolePermission`) for API endpoints
* Prevents unauthorized access to specific modules or data.

**JWT Authentication**

* Uses `djangorestframework-simplejwt` for token-based authentication.
* Each user receives an **access token** (short-lived) and **refresh token** (long-lived) upon login.
* Tokens are verified for each API request.
* Reduces reliance on session cookies, allowing stateless and scalable APIs.

**Secure Password Handling**

* Uses Django's built-in password hashing (PBKDF2).
* Enforces strong password rules via validators.
* Supports password reset and change via Django's auth system.

---

## üß∞ 2. Data Protection & Privacy

**Sensitive Data Access**

* Only authorized roles can access patient details, billing info, or diagnoses.
* Department-based filtering ensures staff only access relevant patient data.

**SQL Injection Prevention**

* Django ORM automatically escapes queries, protecting from SQL injection.

**Data Transmission**

* All API endpoints should use **HTTPS** to encrypt data in transit.
* JWT tokens are sent via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` headers.

---

## üß∞ 3. Input Validation & CSRF Protection

* All POST forms use Django's built-in CSRF token (`{% csrf_token %}`) for web forms.
* DRF API endpoints rely on JWT or session authentication.
* Form and serializer validation ensures only clean and valid data is saved.
* Unique username generation prevents duplicate or invalid entries.

---

## üß∞ 4. Password & Account Security

**Password Validators**

```python
AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [
    {'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.UserAttributeSimilarityValidator'},
    {'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator'},
    {'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator'},
    {'NAME': 'django.contrib.auth.password_validation.NumericPasswordValidator'},
]
````

* Enforces minimum password length and complexity.
* Prevents reuse of weak or common passwords.

**Additional JWT Considerations**

* Ensure **refresh tokens** are stored securely (e.g., HttpOnly cookies or secure storage).
* Set appropriate token expiration times to reduce risk from token leakage.

---

## üß∞ 5. Deployment Security

* Store secrets in environment variables:

```python
SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('DJANGO_SECRET_KEY')
DATABASES['default']['PASSWORD'] = os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')
```

* Disable `DEBUG` in production.
* Limit `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to known domains.
* Use HTTPS and secure headers (HSTS, Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options).

---

## üß∞ 6. API Security & DRF Best Practices

* Use **JWT Authentication** with DRF.
* Apply **permission classes per role**:

```python
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
from users.permissions import RolePermission

class DoctorDashboardView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated, RolePermission]
```

* Use **throttling and rate limiting** (`django-ratelimit` or DRF throttles) to prevent abuse.
* Validate all input using DRF serializers.
* Implement logging of token usage and failed authentication attempts.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices Checklist

* [ ] Rotate `SECRET_KEY` and DB credentials periodically
* [ ] Enforce strong password complexity
* [ ] Disable `DEBUG` on production
* [ ] Apply role-based restrictions on all views and API endpoints
* [ ] Regularly back up the database securely
* [ ] Store JWT refresh tokens securely
* [ ] Log and monitor all login attempts and token usage
* [ ] Use HTTPS for all external URLs and API requests
